      Hi! I'm Jackson Miskill, a third year at UVA studying Computer Science and
      Cognitive Science. I am a native Virginian who grew up loving music and
      the outdoors. Test. <br />
      <br />
      In high school, I became very inspired to help people deal with difficult
      things. Coming into UVA, I thought I wanted to become a lawyer to help
      people (or potentially a therapist). After studying this for a little
      while and figuring some things out, I realized it wasn't for me. The
      biggest reason? I wasn't creating. <br />
      <br />

      In the Summer of 2022, I realized just how much creating meant to me. I
      love to create things. The things I had enjoyed the most about the classes
      I had taken were those projects where I was able to put my owns thoughts
      down, synthesizing content that was taught to me. I still love doing this.
      This is exactly the reason I fell in love with computer science. At the
      tips of our fingers we can create this digital footprints that others can
      see when they come across it. It's beautiful. We can manipulate data and
      write algorithms that will truly help people. This is a beautiful thing.
      <br />
      <br />

      Now that I am wrapping up my time at UVA, I'm thinking towards the future.
      I know I want to help people, I want to create, and I want to be somewhere
      where I can have a ton of fun (hopefully the beach). <br />
      <br />

      I am a big family guy. I love my family, and I am incredibly in debt to
      them. I would not be here today without them challenging and encouraging
      me. <br />
