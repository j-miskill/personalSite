index.html is the home page. This is an industry standard thing. 

Boiler plate code is just the base line code that we need. You can get boiler plate on vscode just by typing "html" and then choosing whichever you want. 

every html page has 2 sections: head and body
    head: set up
    body: the actual content of the website

body:
    h1,h2,h3,h5,h6 -> all heading abbr. for vs code. Will automatically create headings.
    img (tab)-> brings in the image code 

url:
    uniform resource locator-> path to a specific file!
    web browser is simply code that can recognize and view html, css, js, etc

https: 
    hypertext transfer protocol
    special series of hoops browsers must go through in order to get to a file

hosting:
    basically, need to find a site to host a simple html thing. 
    I can write the code for my website, and provide all of the links and stuff, though!
    Can be really easy. 
    I think it would be a better idea for me to do this just because I don't want to have to go through other companies hurdles.
