Welcome to the weirdest thing you will probably ever read.

This is a journal of my life. Inspired by my grandma, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to document various aspects of my life in a more persistent manner than simply writing my thoughts down in a physical journal.

You see, I have actually been keeping a journal for quite some time now, but I have not been incredibly consistent about actually following through with the journal itself. So, I wanted to start this blog/journal in order to keep consistency and to allow my family member from across the country to read through some of the crazy things going on in my life.
What will be going on:

To be clear, I will not be writing about the incredibly intimate details of my life (like how I go to town on Taco Bell value menu burritos with my little brother), but rather include events I go to, thoughts I have, and things I am working on.

I will write a post once a week. The following things will be covered.

    Computer Science and or Cognitive Science
    An event going on/ that has already happened in my life
    Thoughts that I have been having
    Things I have been working on (both physical projects as well as mental/emotional aspirations).

I will include pictures and will write in a conversational-style.

This is the first time I am publishing something like this to the Internet. Furthermore, I am considering this website a long term project that will hopefully continue well into the future! As I figure out what I want to post and donâ€™t want to post, I expect this blog to evolve into what is essentially a virtual version of me.

Thank you for reading.
