This is the code that I will be using to create my personal website.

Once I figure out how to do this a bit better, I'm going to try to host it
somewhere for free.

The goal is to be able to create posts on the website for my blog because
I was using WordPress.com for free, but it's slow, has adds, and has a
ton of buggy features I didn't like. I just want simple.

An indirect goal of this is to learn how to use JavaScript in the React
framework. Also, to add another project to my repotoire.
