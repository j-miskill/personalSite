    <h1>My writing</h1>
    <p>
      I wrote and posted most of these originally on a wordpress site. I have
      decided to make my own site, for greater flexibility! I transfered all of
      the articles over to .txt files into this coding project. <br />
      <br />
      The only thing is that I need to figure out what file type to use for
      these.
    </p>
    Here is the wordpress site:
    <a href="https://jacksonmiskill.wordpress.com/">The Site</a>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <a href="./resources/writing/theBeginning.txt">The Beginning</a>
        <br />
        <a href="./resources/writing/reflections.txt">Reflections</a>
        <br />
        <a href="./resources/writing/eatingFrogs.txt">Eating Frogs</a>
        <br />
        <a href="./resources/writing/anUpdate.txt">An Update</a>
        <br />
        <a href="./resources/writing/codingIsFun.txt">Coding is Fun</a>
        <br />
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
